                <h2>A Special Place For Special People!</h2>
            </div>
            <h3>A quiet community.</h3>
            <div class="rightText">
                <p>
                    Enhance your lifestyle, live close to downtown Orlando with yesterday's charm and today's
                    conveniences.
                    You receive individual attention from, and have direct contact with, the owner when living in the
                    Azalea Garden community (you don't have to contend with a third party management company).
                    <br>
                    Azalea Garden's 24 newly renovated, spacious, luxury apartments provide you with the opportunity to
                    live
                    in comfort at an affordable price in this very QUIET, prestigious, gated community.
                    <br>
                    Each apartment has its own washer and dryer, 2 full baths, HUGE walk-in closets, ceiling fans, new
                    double-paned French doors and fully equipped kitchen (20-22 cu.ft. frost-free refrigerator with
                    filtered
                    ice maker, disposal, dishwasher, self-cleaning oven & built-in microwave).
                    <br>
                    Simply linger in our beautifully landscaped courtyard, or walk along its cobblestone pathways to
                    enjoy
                    the large waterfall as it cascades into a meandering stream which flows across the property under a
                    gracefully arched foot bridge; receiving this babbling brook, the serene koi pond, with its own
                    waterfall, gently flows around our charming gazebo to provide a picture perfect accent to your
                    soothing,
                    relaxing experience. You may also wish to cross the street to Dickson Azalea Park to explore its
                    various
                    varieties of plant life perched along the banks of its ravine.
                    <br>
                    Conveniently located with a bus stop in front, Azalea Gardens is also within walking distance of
                    shopping, Lake Eola, Thornton Park eateries and the downtown Orlando business district;
                    additionally,
                    you are just a 2 block jog to the Downtown YMCA. It is just a couple of minutes to the 408
                    Expressway,
                    Interstate 4, and Highway 50 or Colonial Drive. [ Tell me more ]

                    to walk to some of the best parts of our city and secluded enough to enjoy a night in.
                    <br>
                    <br>Just north of us is the Mills-50 district with all of the amazing restaurants it has to offer,
                    due east you'll find Orlando's newest main street; the Milk District, Thornton Park is
                    to the west sitting right next to Lake Eola and Downtown.
                    <br>Everything is close enough to walk to and just far enough for home to be an escape from it.
